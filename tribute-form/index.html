        <p id="tribute-info">Time — it’s invisible, yet it touches everything.
It ages mountains, fades memories, and heals wounds.
It is the most valuable resource we all share equally, but spend differently.

From sunrise to sunset, time teaches us patience and presence.
It transforms chaos into order, and ideas into reality.
It cannot be stored, paused, or reversed — only respected.

This tribute honors Time, the greatest teacher and the most silent witness to all of life’s beauty, tragedy, growth, and change.</p>
